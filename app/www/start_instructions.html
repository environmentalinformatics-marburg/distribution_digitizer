<h3>⚠️ Extended User Instructions</h3>

<p>Please make sure to follow these important guidelines to ensure accurate results:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Tab 1 - Check the scanned pages:</strong><br>
      Make sure that all scanned pages are well aligned and contain only the content of a single page — avoid any visible edges or parts of neighboring pages.<br>
      <strong>Please also check</strong> that your scanned images are correctly placed under the specified <code>input/pages</code> folder inside your Input Directory.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Tab -2 Choose a well-aligned page for template creation:</strong><br>
      When cropping templates, always select one of the best-aligned scanned pages as the source. Poorly aligned templates can cause serious matching errors.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Tab -2 Crop precisely around the map area:</strong><br>
      When you define a template, ensure that all map borders are fully included, but keep the margin around the border as small as possible (no more than <strong>5 pixels</strong>).<br>
      Avoid including any page text within the cropped template area.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Tab -2 Follow the folder structure shown in the “Create Templates” tab:</strong><br>
      Templates must be saved exactly according to the structure displayed there.<br>
      Otherwise, the program will generate errors and fail to process correctly.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Tab -2 If your templates are not perfectly aligned:</strong><br>
      Use software such as <a href="https://scantailor.org/downloads/<strong>ScanTailor" target="_blank">ScanTailor</strong></a> or <a href="https://www.gimp.org/downloads" target="_blank"><strong>GIMP</strong></a> to re-align and correct them.<br>
      After fixing the templates, save them again according to the “Create Templates” guidelines, and make sure to <strong>activate the “Align” checkbox</strong> if you want this part of the processing to be applied.
  </li>
</ol>
