2. Detect maps;High threshold values will lead to few detections, low values to many detections. Start with the threshold value 0.4 and keep decreasing it until all the outputs are extracted. The minimum possible output value will be 0.2.	;Threshold (for map detection with template matching);Start;You can find the extracted maps in your output directory /data/output/maps/matching/;2.1. Auto align the maps;Try to align the maps. The results are saved in /data/output/maps/align/;Start; 2.2 Crop map species;this modul crop the map spaceis name and rename the align maps; Start;Start the search for the species. The ones found are appended to the file names of the corresponding file in directory /data/output/maps/align/;
