2. Detect maps;Adjust the threshold to control detection accuracy. Begin with 0.4. If not all maps are detected, lower the value step by step (not below 0.15).;Matching Threshold;Please select the parameter: 1 for Template Matching, 2 for Contour Matching;Start Detection;You can find the extracted maps in your output directory /data/output/maps/matching/;2.1. Align the maps;After detection, maps may be slightly shifted or rotated. Aligning the maps corrects their position and orientation, so that all maps match consistently across the book and further processing (e.g., georeferencing) is accurate. The results are saved in /data/output/maps/align/;Start Align; 2.2 Cropp map species; Start Cropping;Start the search for the map species. The ones found will be appended to the file names of the corresponding file in directory /data/output/maps/align/;2.4 Cropp page species;Start Reading page species; Reading species data from page files, processing it, and saving the results to a new CSV file pageSpeciesData in D:/distribution_digitizer/data/output.;Please input the page number, if not provided, the listing process will display all maps.;Use this field to restrict processing to specific pages <br>– Enter a range with a dash (e.g., 1–5 or 5–99) → all pages in the range are processed.  <br>– Enter the exact file name (e.g., 0088.tif) → only this page file is processed. <br>– Enter the word (ALL) → all pages of the book are processed.;Limit listed maps (empty = all range = from–to);
